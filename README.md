# CX-O_INTERACTION

Motifs are stretch of amino acids which are conserved and associated with distinct functions of a protein or DNA. We know protein-protein interaction plays a very critical role in biological processing, hence we need to understand the different types of interaction contributing to their role. Two motifs, AXXXA and GXXXG have been found in homodimers and heterodimers and they are important for their enzymatic activity and dimerization process. The algorithm finds out the motifs and analyze it to find the different interaction between the terminal and middle residues of motifs.
